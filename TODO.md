# Deployment Plan - Free Tier Options

## Overview
This project will be deployed using free tiers from Railway (backend + database) and Vercel/Netlify (frontend).

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Railway account (railway.app)
- Vercel/Netlify account

## Step 1: Prepare Code for Production âœ…
- [x] Update backend environment variables (remove hardcoded DB credentials)
- [x] Update CORS settings for production URLs
- [x] Create production .env template
- [x] Update client API base URLs for production

## Step 2: Set up Railway Project
- [ ] Create new Railway project
- [ ] Add MySQL database service
- [ ] Configure database environment variables

## Step 3: Deploy Backend to Railway
- [ ] Push backend code to GitHub
- [ ] Connect Railway to GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure build and start commands
- [ ] Set environment variables in Railway
- [ ] Deploy backend

## Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Push frontend code to GitHub
- [ ] Connect Vercel/Netlify to GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure build settings
- [ ] Set environment variables for API URL
- [ ] Deploy frontend

## Step 5: Update Domain and CORS
- [ ] Get Railway backend URL
- [ ] Update frontend environment variables
- [ ] Update backend CORS origins
- [ ] Test the deployed application

## Free Tier Limitations
- Railway: Backend sleeps after 24h inactivity, 512MB RAM, 1GB disk
- PlanetScale: 1 database, 1GB storage, 100M row reads/month
- Vercel/Netlify: Unlimited static sites, generous bandwidth limits
