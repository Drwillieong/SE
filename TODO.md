# Analytics 404 Error Fix - TODO

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. **Root Cause Analysis**
- Identified that analytics routes were not imported or mounted in `server.js`
- Found that `/api/admin/analytics` endpoint was missing from admin routes
- Confirmed that analytics controller and routes existed but weren't connected

### 2. **Server Configuration Updates**
- ✅ Added `import analyticsRoutes from './routes/analytics.js';` to `backend/server.js`
- ✅ Mounted analytics routes at `/api/analytics` with JWT authentication
- ✅ Added admin analytics route at `/api/admin/analytics` in `backend/routes/admin.js`

### 3. **Route Implementation**
- ✅ `/api/analytics` - General analytics endpoint (requires JWT token)
- ✅ `/api/admin/analytics` - Admin-specific analytics endpoint (requires admin role)

## Next Steps 🔄

### 1. **Testing**
- [ ] Restart the backend server to apply changes
- [ ] Test `/api/analytics?range=7d` endpoint with valid JWT token
- [ ] Test `/api/admin/analytics?range=7d` endpoint with admin JWT token
- [ ] Verify that frontend can successfully fetch analytics data
- [ ] Check browser console for any remaining 404 errors

### 2. **Verification**
- [ ] Confirm that analytics data is being returned correctly
- [ ] Test different range parameters (7d, 30d, 90d)
- [ ] Verify that authentication is working properly
- [ ] Check that admin-only endpoints reject non-admin users

### 3. **Error Handling**
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid tokens, database errors)
- [ ] Ensure proper error responses are returned
- [ ] Verify CORS settings are correct for frontend requests

## Files Modified 📝
- `backend/server.js` - Added analytics route imports and mounting
- `backend/routes/admin.js` - Added admin analytics endpoint

## Expected Results 🎯
- No more 404 errors for analytics endpoints
- Analytics data should be accessible via API calls
- Proper authentication and authorization in place
- Frontend should be able to display analytics data successfully
